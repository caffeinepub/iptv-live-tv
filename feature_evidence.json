The HTML root element must have the 'dark' class applied at all times (or the app must be configured to always use the dark color scheme). All components — including the navigation bar, channel grid, channel cards, filter controls, video player, and modals — must use the dark cinematic CSS variable tokens (deep dark backgrounds #0d0d0d to #1a1a2e, red/amber accents) already defined in frontend/src/index.css.

For M3U/guest users, show channels whose IDs are stored in useLocalFavourites. For authenticated users, show channels from the backend getFavourites list. The section must be accessible via the existing 'Favourites' filter tab in the Navigation bar and must compose with all active filters (search, language, country) so that favourite channels can be further narrowed down.",
